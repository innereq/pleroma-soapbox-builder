# Pleroma Soapbox-FE Builder

[![Daily Integration](https://github.com/innereq/pleroma-soapbox-builder/workflows/Daily%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/innereq/pleroma-soapbox-builder/actions?query=workflow%3A"Daily+Integration")

It does some things for us:

- builds an upstream development version of Soapbox-FE;
- applies tiny instance-specific changes;
- deploys to our servers;
- every day! Actually, every night, but whatever.
